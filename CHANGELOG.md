# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.36] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **S3-Compatible Folder Delete**: Folder deletion now falls back to per-object deletes when an S3-compatible provider rejects the multi-object delete request, fixing recursive folder deletion on SwiftStack-style storage.

## [0.2.35] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed
- **Profile Secret Preservation**: Editing a profile between manual credentials and custom S3-compatible endpoints now preserves the saved secret when the update payload omits it, and only clears stored secrets when switching to a non-secret authentication method.
- **Windows TLS Startup Stability**: Updated the AWS SDK runtime stack to remove the rustls native-root debug assertion path without replacing the operating system trust store.

## [0.2.34] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Unreadable Object Protection**: The backend now rejects invalid UTF-8 and obvious binary payloads instead of lossy-decoding them into the text editor, preventing accidental corruption of non-text objects.
- **Object Editability Detection**: Ambiguous object names no longer depend on a giant text-extension allowlist. `content-type` stays authoritative, and unknown names fall back safely without blocking valid text objects that have uncommon or no suffixes.

## [0.2.33] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Cross-Platform Installer Reliability**: Windows installers now bundle the WebView2 runtime offline, reducing install failures on fresh systems.
- **Release Pipeline Stability**: Reworked GitHub release publishing to upload generated bundles directly and keep the shipped version aligned with the repo version instead of the workflow run number.
- **Updater Signing Alignment**: Updated the Tauri updater public key to match the newly rotated release signing key used in GitHub Actions.
- **Startup Update Flow**: Prevented automatic update installation during app launch so updater checks no longer race the UI or installer flow.
- **Windows Profile Persistence**: Replaced the failing save path on Windows with a cross-platform-safe write strategy so saved profiles are not lost on restart.
- **Profile Secret Preservation**: Editing an existing manual or custom-endpoint profile now preserves previously saved secrets when the edit payload omits them.
- **Default Profile State Sync**: Active/default profile flags now stay consistent after add, edit, delete, and restart flows.

## [0.2.32] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Presigned URL Sharing**: Added a dedicated "Get Presigned URL" action in the bucket object menu for files, with configurable expiry presets and custom durations.

### Fixed
- **Custom S3 Profile Persistence**: Profiles saved without inline secrets now load correctly on startup instead of being discarded when `profiles.json` is parsed.
- **Saved Secret Hydration**: Opening an existing manual or Custom S3 profile now repopulates the saved secret from secure storage in the edit form.
- **Profile Startup Race**: Credentials/profile state is now initialized before frontend commands run, preventing empty-profile startup races on slower launches.
- **macOS Distribution Path**: Added ad-hoc signing fallback in Tauri config and optional Apple signing/notarization credential support in CI to reduce "app is damaged" install failures on macOS releases.
- **Release Workflow Looping**: Prevented bot-authored `update.json` commits from retriggering the publish workflow and added retries/fail-fast checks around release asset discovery.
- **CI Release Stability**: macOS CI now builds the updater-compatible app bundle directly instead of DMG packaging, and GitHub Actions dependencies were updated for the Node 24 runner transition.
- **Presigned URL Validation**: Prevented invalid expiry values above the AWS 7-day limit from attempting a presign request.
- **Release Workflow Diagnostics**: Improved signing-key checks and asset matching logs in the release workflow to make updater failures easier to diagnose.
- **Updater Key Alignment**: Updated the Tauri updater public key to match the regenerated signing key used for releases.

## [0.2.31] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- **Auto-Update Signing**: Regenerated signing keys without password to fix signature verification issues.

## [0.2.30] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- **Dynamic Version in Footer**: Footer now fetches version dynamically from Tauri API instead of hardcoded value. Version will always be correct after updates.
- **Auto-Update Signatures**: Enabled `includeUpdaterJson` in release workflow to upload `.sig` files for auto-update functionality.

## [0.2.29] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- **Auto-Update Signatures**: Enable `includeUpdaterJson: true` in release workflow to ensure `.sig` files are uploaded to releases, fixing auto-update on all platforms.

## [0.2.28] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **Auto-Update for All Platforms**: Regenerated Tauri signing keys to enable auto-update functionality. Updates will now work properly on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## [0.2.27] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **Ubuntu Checkbox Stability (Final Fix)**: Created custom `StyledCheckbox` component replacing all MUI Checkbox usage:
  - Uses pure CSS/SVG styling with fixed 14x14px SVG container
  - All states (unchecked/checked/indeterminate) use same layout to prevent shifts
  - Removed MUI Checkbox from VirtualizedObjectTable and bucket page
  - No animations or transitions that could crash WebKitGTK

## [0.2.26] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **Ubuntu Checkbox Crash (Take 2)**: Replaced MUI Checkbox component with native HTML checkboxes in the object table. MUI's Checkbox uses complex SVG rendering and animations that overwhelm WebKitGTK on Ubuntu. Native checkboxes have minimal DOM operations and are fully stable.

## [0.2.25] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **Ubuntu Crash on Multiple Checkbox Selection**: Critical fix for WebKitGTK crash when clicking multiple checkboxes in the object table. Root cause was `useMemo` recreating the Virtuoso context object on every selection change, triggering a full re-render cascade that overwhelmed WebKitGTK. Fixed by using a stable `useRef` pattern that maintains the same context object identity across renders.

## [0.2.24] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Ubuntu Crash on Checkbox Click**: Critical fix for WebKitGTK crashes when selecting items. Disabled MUI checkbox ripple effects and CSS transitions that were overwhelming the GPU compositor.
- **Ubuntu Flickering on Selection**: Refactored `VirtualizedObjectTable` to use `react-virtuoso`'s `context` prop for stable row rendering. Selection state no longer causes full callback recreation.
- **App Freezing on Window Return**: Disabled aggressive auto-refresh on focus by default. Added smart throttling to `useTransferEvents` - progress updates are paused when hidden but terminal events (Complete/Failed) always process.
- **Editor Save Button State**: Properly tracks Monaco Editor's internal version ID for accurate undo/redo detection.
- **Folder Copy Not Recursive**: Backend `copy_object` now recursively copies all nested objects when copying a folder.
- **Transfer Progress CPU Storm**: Bucket page no longer re-renders on every transfer progress tick (was 60fps). Uses `subscribe` instead of reactive state.

### Changed
- **Removed FreezeDetector**: The auto-reload component was removed as it was causing disruptive reloads instead of helping.
- **Removed Format Button**: Removed the Format button from the editor dialog as requested.
- **Auto-Refresh Off by Default**: `autoRefreshOnFocus` is now disabled by default in settings to prevent freezes.

### Improved
- **Release Workflow**: Enhanced `update.json` generation with better asset matching, debugging output, and support for x64/x86_64 naming variations.

## [0.2.22] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Recursive Folder Delete**: True recursive deletion implemented. Bypassing cache and proper delimiter handling ensures all nested files and subfolders are fully removed.
- **Selection State Persistence**: Folders and files are now automatically deselected when navigating between different bucket paths or prefixes.
- **UI Polish - Table Headers**: Fixed an issue where table headers would disappear during the loading/refresh state.
- **Delete Action Reliability**: Fixed a bug where confirming a delete action from the context menu would sometimes fail to trigger the operation.
- **Dependencies**: Aligned `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog` NPM package version with the Rust crate to resolve build failures.

## [0.2.21] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Modal Close Button**: Removed spinning animation on close button hover for cleaner UI.
- **Preview File Size Limit**: Added 2MB limit for text file previews to prevent browser freeze on large files.
- **Folder Rename Warning**: Added warning when renaming folders that will affect all contained objects.

### Changed
- **Comprehensive Codebase Audit**: Completed full file-by-file scan of 59 files (43 frontend + 16 backend). No critical bugs found.

## [0.2.20] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Periodic Transfer Sync**: Transfer state now syncs with backend every 5 seconds for consistency.
- **Visibility-Based Refresh**: Buckets and objects auto-refresh when returning to app (with 30s debounce).

### Fixed
- **Transfer Panel State**: Panel hidden state now persists across page navigation.
- **Profile Loading Race**: Removed duplicate profile loading between AppShell and ProfileSelector.
- **useEffect Dependencies**: Fixed missing/stale dependencies in bucket page and useTransferEvents.
- **Transfer Event Stability**: Event listeners now use refs to prevent unnecessary re-subscriptions.

## [0.2.19] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Auto-Edit Mode**: Clicking "Edit" on a file now opens it directly in edit mode (no extra click required).
- **Freeze Detection & Recovery**: App automatically detects UI freezes and auto-reloads to recover.

### Improved
- **Simplified Navigation**: Removed redundant "Buckets" nav item, renamed "Explorer" to "Home".
- **Tab Management**: Fixed tab deduplication so clicking Home/nav items switches to existing tabs instead of creating duplicates.
- **Search Experience**: Deep search now has 30-second timeout, shows "No Results" toast, and proper error messages.
- **Transfer Panel**: Moved panel up from bottom edge to be visible above footer.
- **Toast Notifications**: File save success now shows as toast instead of inline Alert.

### Fixed
- **Search [object object] Error**: Fixed improper error string conversion in search error display.

## [0.2.18] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **Unused Imports Cleanup**: Removed 7 unused icon imports and `getCurrentWindow` from TopBar component for smaller bundle size.
- **React Anti-pattern**: Fixed calling `getState()` during render in AppShell which could cause stale UI.
- **Error Handling**: Fixed type check order in Tauri invoke wrapper so Error messages are properly extracted.
- **Hook Dependencies**: Removed stale dependencies from `useObjects` refresh callback.
- **Transfer Panel**: Added missing `TransferPanel` component render so users can now see file transfer progress.
 
## [0.2.17] - 2026-01-15
 
### Added

- **Improved Linux Support**: Added high-resolution (512x512) app icon for pixel-perfect rendering on Ubuntu/Linux desktops.
- **Download Controls**: Added consistent "Retry" and "Cancel" actions for download jobs.

### Fixed
- **Large Download Freeze**: Resolved critical UI freeze when downloading large files (10GB+) by implementing smart progress event throttling.
- **Sidebar Loading Glitch**: Fixed a race condition where rapidly switching buckets could display incorrect data from stale network requests.
- **Table Stability**: Fixed layout shifts and indentation issues in transfer tables (Downloads/Uploads) for a rock-solid UI.

## [0.2.16] - 2026-01-14
 
### Added
- **Custom App Icon**: New premium goose mascot branding across app icon, header, and About dialog.
- **Instant Theme Switching**: Removed all transition delays for snappy dark/light mode toggling.

### Improved

- **Tab Close Button**: Enlarged close button (16px) for easier clicking.
- **About Dialog**: Streamlined by removing developer/usage info sections.

### Fixed
- **Transfer Panel**: Added Started, Finished, and Elapsed time columns with correct timestamps.
- **Uploads Page**: Applied same time column improvements and verified grouping logic.

## [0.2.15] - 2026-01-13

## [0.2.14] - 2026-01-13
 
### Added
- **Deep Search Overhaul**: Increased recursive search depth by 5x (scans up to 50,000 objects). Added context-aware prefix support and robust region auto-retry logic for exhaustive searching.
- **Tab Deduplication**: The search bar now intelligently switches to existing tabs if the target path is already open, preventing workspace clutter.

### Fixed
- **Application Stability**: Resolved critical `TypeError` crashes during navigation by implementing mandatory `Suspense` boundaries for Next.js layouts.
- **Enhanced Safety**: Added defensive null-checks for search parameters and default props for virtualization tables to eliminate "Load failed" errors.
- **State Cleanup**: Implemented global reset logic when deleting profiles, ensuring all tabs, history, and regions are cleared for a clean slate.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-01-13
 
### Added
- **Automatic Region Discovery**: Profiles imported from generic `~/.aws/config` files now automatically detect and select the correct region, eliminating manual configuration.
- **Direct Object Navigation**: Support for pasting direct S3 file URIs (e.g., `s3://bucket/file.json`). The app intelligently distinguishes between files and folders without forcing trailing slashes.
- **Extended File Support**: Massive expansion of supported editable file types. Now supports editing and previewing for YAML, TOML, INI, Shell Scripts, Rust, Go, Python, Terraform, Dockerfiles, and many more.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-01-12

## [0.2.11] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **Release Automation**: Updated workflow to automatically extract changelog notes for GitHub Releases.
- **Linux Window Controls**: Added native file/window menus for Linux to improve window manager integration and address potential close button responsiveness issues.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **Restricted Prefix Navigation**: Fixed manual path navigation (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) to correctly use the active profile's region. This enables users to jump directly to specific S3 folders (e.g., `s3://bucket/prefix/`) even if they don't have permission to list the bucket root.
- **S3 Error Logging**: (Included) The fix for opaque error logging (`[object Object]`) is now properly included in this release.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **S3 Error Logging**: Fixed opaque error messages (previously showing as `[object Object]`) when accessing restricted buckets. Now correctly displays "Access Denied" or other backend errors to help with debugging permissions.
## [0.2.7] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- **Connection Setup Error**: Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'invoke')" error on the new connection setup page when running in web context. The Tauri invoke function is now dynamically imported only when running inside the Tauri desktop application.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- **Auto-Update Not Working**: Fixed the `update.json` manifest generation in GitHub Actions workflow. The previous version had a bash subshell bug that caused platform URLs and signatures to not be populated. Auto-update should now work correctly on all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux).

## [0.2.5] - 2026-01-10

## [0.2.4] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- **All Buckets Page Refresh**: Fixed loading skeleton not showing during refresh - now properly displays loading state when clicking Refresh.
- **Bucket View Refresh**: Fixed skeleton overlay visibility issue in bucket content view.
- **Footer Version**: Updated footer to display correct version number.

### Performance
- **Transfer Store Optimization**: Skip state updates when transfer progress hasn't changed, reducing unnecessary re-renders during heavy file transfers.
- **Icon Caching**: Pre-populated icon map with 47 file type icons for O(1) lookup instead of creating JSX elements on every render.
- **useBuckets**: Removed unnecessary `useMemo` wrapper from trivial cache age calculation.

### Changed
- **MUI Stock Experience**: Reverted to stock Material UI styling for menus, buttons, and inputs instead of heavy customizations for a more consistent and familiar UI.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- **Bucket Refresh**: Fixed refresh button not showing loading state. Now clears data immediately and properly refreshes from S3.
- **Backend Cache Invalidation**: Implemented `remove_bucket_cache` in Rust backend to properly clear stale data on refresh.

### Changed
- **UI Polish - Less Rounding**: Reduced border-radius across the app for a cleaner look:
  - Buttons: 8px → 6px with smaller padding
  - Inputs: 8px → 6px
  - Dropdown menus: 8px with compact items (8px 12px padding)
- **Navbar Dropdown**: Added visible outlined border to Profile Selector dropdown trigger.
- **Dropdown Styling**: Fixed invisible dropdown issue, added proper shadows and borders.
- **Compact Fonts**: Reduced font sizes across dropdowns and buttons (0.8125rem).


## [0.2.2] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- **PathBar Navigation**: Fixed invalid URL handling - now shows error toast and prevents navigation instead of loading existing buckets
- **Bucket Error Handling**: Added graceful error UI when bucket is not found, with helpful actions ("Back to Home" and "Try Again")
- **React Key Warnings**: Resolved React key prop warnings in PathBar autocomplete component
- **Console Logging**: Reduced console noise - fetch errors now only log in development mode with cleaner formatting
- **Copy Options**: Properly separated copy menu items:
  - **Copy Filename**: Copies just the filename with extension (e.g., `file.txt`)
  - **Copy Key**: Copies the S3 key path (e.g., `folder/subfolder/file.txt`)
  - **Copy S3 URI**: Copies full S3 URI (e.g., `s3://bucket-name/folder/file.txt`)
- **Page Scrolling**: Fixed overflow and scrolling issues in Recent and Favorites pages

### Changed
- **Layout Consistency**: Unified spacing across all pages:
  - Recent, Favorites, Downloads, Uploads now use full width (removed 800px maxWidth)
  - Reduced padding from `3` to `1` with top margin for consistency
  - All pages now have icon + title header layout (added StorageIcon to Buckets page)
  - Fixed scrolling behavior with proper flex and overflow properties
- **Main Content Spacing**: Added horizontal padding (px: 2) to main content area for better breathing room
- **PathBar UI**: Reduced search bar width (600px → 450px) and improved centering in navbar with balanced spacing

- **Copy Filename**: Added context menu action to copy just the filename of an object.
- **Paste Logic**: Improved paste functionality. Pasting a file into the same folder now auto-renames it with a timestamp to prevent accidental overwrites.

### Changed
- **UI Polish**:
  - Compacted the "Deep Search" toggle to a clean checkbox.
  - Fixed "Size" column in file tables to prevent text wrapping (e.g., "53.6 KB" stays on one line).
  - Updated "About" modal styles and fixed links.
- **PDF Rendering**: Switched from `iframe` to `<embed>` for better cross-platform compatibility and stricter `Content-Type` enforcement in the backend.
- **Performance**: Optimized S3 listing with smart caching and background indexing.
